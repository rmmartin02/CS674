 CPU Trace Driven: Ramulator directly reads instruction traces from a file, and simulates a simplified model of a "core" that generates memory requests to the DRAM subsystem. Each line in the trace file represents a memory request, and can have one of the following two formats.

 <num-cpuinst> <addr-read>: For a line with two tokens, the first token represents the number of CPU (i.e., non-memory) instructions before the memory request, and the second token is the decimal address of a read.


 <num-cpuinst> <addr-read> <addr-writeback>: For a line with three tokens, the third token is the decimal address of the writeback request, which is the dirty cache-line eviction caused by the read request before it.
